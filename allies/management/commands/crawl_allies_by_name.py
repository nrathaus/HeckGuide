        This class imports allies currently in the database that are missing full results. The "owner" object
        that is returned does not returns a partial dataset, so this method looks for allies that have a null
        biome3 attack multiplier and fetches the full dataset for that ally.

        It will first fetch the ally, then the owner, then the owner's owner, etc until we're 'depth' layers deep.
